Which chemical and physical properties of US oil pipeline loads are correlated with pipeline accidents, according to data from 2010 to 2016? Since the dataset contains multiple liquid types, I will be considering all of them, and not only crude oil.\n","2. After exploring the data, which properties should be subject to tighter regulations, and to what capacity?\n","3. Based on the trends over time, have existing regulations appeared to be effective in reducing pipeline accidents?\n","\n","**Approach to the questions**:\n","\n","1. Use data analytics and visualization methods to show how often certain feature values appear in the dataset\n","2. Use an unsupervised learning method to show how combinations of oil properties play a factor in frequency of pipeline accidents\n","3. Draw conclusions from the data, and observe trends in changes in properties of interest over time to determine whether regulations have been improving\n","\n","**Steps (Python)**:\n","\n","1. Retrieve the **US Oil Pipeline Accidents** dataset from Kaggle, and load it as a Pandas DataFrame\n","2. Explore the dataset: types of data, number of rows, number and names of columns (features)\n","3. Remove irrelevant features to the question being asked (i.e. since we are only interested in the physical and chemical properties, we can remove unrelated features)\n","4. Clean up the relevant dataset by checking for null values, and populate them with reasonable values\n","5. Plot distributions of distinctive features to show distributions (i.e. bar charts for categorical variables)\n","6. Use K-modes clustering, with an arbitrary value of K, to find similar groups in the dataset. The K-modes algorithm is used instead of K-means, as the majority of features in this dataset are categorical\n","7. Group the dataset by year to show the frequency of accidents over time"],"metadata":{"id":"KFFJU1eCiur5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Loading and preparing the dataset"],"metadata":{"id":"Mgg302F_k6-i"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"WJW_b529ipf6"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Package import\n","\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Load the pipeline accident dataset\n","# Convert the .csv file to a Pandas DataFrame\n","\n","dataset = pd.read_csv('database.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"XnzvoseR1l9I"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Print the first 5 rows to see what the dataset looks like\n","\n","dataset.head(5)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":542},"id":"24dM_tQk2KVC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1671825615577,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Titania Yan","userId":"04370019860924395494"}},"outputId":"f71ee5eb-7669-4e97-ffe3-b8daba64efa5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   Report Number  Supplemental Number  Accident Year Accident Date/Time  \\\n","0       20100016                17305           2010   1/1/2010 7:15 AM   \n","1       20100254                17331           2010   1/4/2010 8:30 AM   \n","2       20100038                17747           2010  1/5/2010 10:30 AM   \n","3       20100260                18574           2010   1/6/2010 7:30 PM   \n","4       20100030                16276           2010   1/7/2010 1:00 PM   \n","\n","   Operator ID                         Operator Name Pipeline/Facility Name  \\\n","0        32109                 ONEOK NGL PIPELINE LP      KINDER MORGAN JCT   \n","1        15786                PORTLAND PIPELINE CORP      24-INCH MAIN LINE   \n","2        20160           PETROLOGISTICS OLEFINS, LLC                    NaN   \n","3        11169  ENBRIDGE ENERGY, LIMITED PARTNERSHIP      SUPERIOR TERMINAL   \n","4          300                 PLAINS PIPELINE, L.P.

involved crude oil. The next most frequent type of oil was refined/petroleum product (34%), followed by high viscosity lubricant (HVL) or other types of flammable and toxic gas fluids. Carbon dioxide and biofuel/alternative fuels had the lowest proportions of accidents (1% and nearly 0%, respectively).\n","- Out of the available liquid subtypes, the most common subtype associated with accidents was diesel, fuel oil, jet fuel, and kerosene, followed by gasoline.\n","- Out of the available liquid names, the most common name associated with accidents was propane, followed by ethane.\n","- Most accidents did not involve liquid ignition (97%), as opposed to those that did (3%).\n","- Most accidents did not involve liquid explosion (99%), as opposed to those that did (1%).\n","\n","**Physical and chemical properties most responsible for pipeline accidents**\n","\n","- Crude oil appears to have caused far more accidents than any other type of liquid. However, this may simply be due to real-world scaling considerations, where crude oil may be the most commonly transported oil in pipelines, and therefore, it would make sense proportionally.\n","- For more refined oils, diesel, fuel oil, jet fuel, and kerosene have caused the most accidents. These are all petroleum-based oils, which contain a significant portion of crude oil ([source](https://www.epa.gov/emergency-response/types-refined-petroleum-products)).\n","- The overwhelming majority of accidents did not involve liquid ignition or explosion. However, for those that did, HVL and other toxic/flammable fluids caused the highest proportion of them, followed by crude oil. Most of these liquids consisted of low molecular weight hydrocarbons (i.e. ethane and propane derivatives).\n","\n","**Potential physical/chemical regulations to reduce likelihood of pipeline accidents**\n","\n","- High degrees of vigilance are required for transporting liquids containing crude oil via pipelines. 100% crude oil, as well as petroleum-containing oils, should be subject to stricter monitoring and surveillance along multiple checkpoints within the oil transportation pipeline.\n","- Liquid ignition and explosion, although relatively rare, imply accidents of greater severity and damage. By far, HVL and associated subtypes of oil were responsible for most liquid ignitions and explosions, and these liquids typically contain a high fraction of low-molecular weight compounds. Low-molecular weight compounds generally have a higher vapour pressure, which leads to more volatility and potential for ignitions and explosions ([source](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-2565-0_18)). For this reason, it is crucially important to control the environmental conditions to minimize the risk of liquid ignitions and explosions. Introducing regulation to better control the external transportation environment for these liquids may reduce the likelihood of accidents."],"metadata":{"id":"uaGcln_OAYU7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Finding similar groups in the dataset using K-modes
